        <h2>Specializing in real estate transactions and title work.</h2>
        <p>
          In Florida real estate deals, parties rely on title insurance to ensure that they are purchasing or conveying marketable title to the property.  Careful examination of title and lien searches is vital to a successful transaction.  At Chase Law, we are dedicated to a thorough review of all title matters in a transaction.  Buying or selling a home is an important decision. We are here for our clients at every stage of the transaction.
        </p>
        <p>  
          We provide full title services as well as the comfort of having a lawyer handle your file from beginning to end.  No transaction is too big or too small.  Our costs are comparable to title companies but our representation of clients is superior.  The Chase Law team is in constant communication with realtors, lenders, mortgage brokers, condominium associations and other entities integral to the transaction.  We work together with all parties to ensure a smooth and timely closing.
